\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my primary supervisor Dr.\ Kathy Ruggiero for her continual support and patience throughout my PhD study. As well as providing an enormous amount of ideas, time and guidance both on my project and the thesis.

Besides my primary supervisor, I would like to acknowledge to my co-supervisors Prof.\ Chris Triggs and Dr.\ Richard Jarrett, who have been influential in my statistical thinking, and provided crucial support, expertise and important considerations throughout my PhD study.
 
I would also like to thank all the friends and colleagues in Bioinformatic Institute, Statistical Consulting Centre and Centre of Methods and Policy Application in the Social Sciences for all the helps and encouragements. 

Finally, I would like to thank my family for all the support throughout my PhD study to make it all possible.
