  abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling
	the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults,
	and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple
	significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected
	proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate.
	This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are
	true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control
	of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired,
	there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type
	procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent
	test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power
	is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness
	of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  title = {Precise protein quantification based on peptide quantification using
	iTRAQ},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {214-214},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mass spectrometry based quantification of peptides can
	be performed using the iTRAQ reagent in conjunction with mass spectrometry.
	This technology yields information about the relative abundance of
	single peptides. A method for the calculation of reliable quantification
	information is required in order to obtain biologically relevant
	data at the protein expression level. RESULTS: A method comprising
	sound error estimation and statistical methods is presented that
	allows precise abundance analysis plus error calculation at the peptide
	as well as at the protein level. This yields the relevant information
	that is required for quantitative proteomics. Comparing the performance
	of our method named Quant with existing approaches the error estimation
	is reliable and offers information for precise bioinformatic models.
	Quant is shown to generate results that are consistent with those
	produced by ProQuant, thus validating both systems. Moreover, the
	results are consistent with that of Mascot 2.2. The MATLAB scripts
	of Quant are freely available via http://www.protein-ms.de and http://sourceforge.net/projects/protms/,
	each under the GNU Lesser General Public License. CONCLUSION: The
	software Quant demonstrates improvements in protein quantification
	using iTRAQ. Precise quantification data can be obtained at the protein
	level when using error propagation and adequate visualization. Quant
	integrates both and additionally provides the possibility to obtain
	more reliable results by calculation of wise quality measures. Peak
	area integration has been replaced by sum of intensities, yielding
	more reliable quantification results. Additionally, Quant allows
	the combination of quantitative information obtained by iTRAQ with
	peptide and protein identifications from popular tandem MS identification
	tools. Hence Quant is a useful tool for the proteomics community
	and may help improving analysis of proteomic experimental data. In
	addition, we have shown that a lognormal distribution fits the data
	of mass spectrometry based relative peptide quantification.},

  abstract = {The use of several structure formulae has many advantages for specifying

	The first formula usually defines the systematic (or treatment) terms,

	error to be determined for each term and enables the full information
	to be obtained on terms that are estimated in more than one stratum.
	The formulae should be derived from sets of factors, based on the
	randomization, and termed tiers. A detailed discussion of data from
	a tasting trial of produce from a viticultural experiment shows that
	sometimes more than two tiers, and hence structure formulae, may
	be needed. A new algorithm is developed to determine the structure
	of such multiphase experiments, and to generate their correct analysis.},

  abstract = {Heart disease is the major cause of death in diabetes, a disorder

	Although altered systemic regulation of transition metals in diabetes
	has been the subject of previous investigation, it is not known whether
	changed transition metal metabolism results in heart disease in common
	forms of diabetes and whether metal chelation can reverse the condition.
	We found that administration of the Cu-selective transition metal
	chelator trientine to rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes caused
	increased urinary Cu excretion compared with matched controls. A
	CuII-trientine complex was demonstrated in the urine of treated rats.
	In diabetic animals with established heart failure, we show here
	for the first time that 7 weeks of oral trientine therapy significantly
	alleviated heart failure without lowering blood glucose, substantially
	improved cardiomyocyte structure, and reversed elevations in left
	ventricular collagen and {beta}1 integrin. Oral trientine treatment
	also caused elevated Cu excretion in humans with type 2 diabetes,
	in whom 6 months of treatment caused elevated left ventricular mass
	to decline significantly toward normal. These data implicate accumulation
	of elevated loosely bound Cu in the mechanism of cardiac damage in

	genetic system to study these interactions by taking advantage of
	the properties of the GAL4 protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
	This protein is a transcriptional activator required for the expression
	of genes encoding enzymes of galactose utilization. It consists of
	two separable and functionally essential domains: an N-terminal domain
	which binds to specific DNA sequences (UASG); and a C-terminal domain
	containing acidic regions, which is necessary to activate transcription.
	We have generated a system of two hybrid proteins containing parts
	of GAL4: the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to a protein 'X' and a
	GAL4 activating region fused to a protein 'Y'. If X and Y can form
	a protein-protein complex and reconstitute proximity of the GAL4
	domains, transcription of a gene regulated by UASG occurs. We have
	tested this system using two yeast proteins that are known to interact--SNF1
	and SNF4. High transcriptional activity is obtained only when both
	hybrids are present in a cell. This system may be applicable as a
	general method to identify proteins that interact with a known protein

  abstract = {Any orthogonal block structure for a set of experimental units has
	been previously shown to be expressible by a set of mutually orthogonal,
	idempotent matrices C<sub>i</sub>. When differential treatments are
	applied to the units, any linear model of treatment effects is expressible
	by another set of mutually orthogonal idempotent matrices T<sub>j</sub>.
	The analysis of any experiment having any set of treatments applied
	in any pattern whatever to units with an orthogonal block structure,
	is expressible in terms of the matrices C<sub>i</sub>, T<sub>j</sub>
	and the design matrix N, which lists the treatments applied to each
	unit. A unit-treatment additivity assumption and a valid randomization
	are essential to the validity of the analysis. The relevant estimation
	equations are developed for this general situation, and the idea
	of balance is given a generalized definition, which is illustrated
	by several examples. An outline is sketched for a general computer
	program to deal with the analysis of all experiments with an orthogonal

  abstract = {The shotgun proteomic strategy based on digesting proteins into peptides
	and sequencing them using tandem mass spectrometry and automated
	database searching has become the method of choice for identifying
	proteins in most large scale studies. However, the peptide-centric
	nature of shotgun proteomics complicates the analysis and biological
	interpretation of the data especially in the case of higher eukaryote
	organisms. The same peptide sequence can be present in multiple different
	proteins or protein isoforms. Such shared peptides therefore can
	lead to ambiguities in determining the identities of sample proteins.
	In this article we illustrate the difficulties of interpreting shotgun
	proteomic data and discuss the need for common nomenclature and transparent
	informatic approaches. We also discuss related issues such as the
	state of protein sequence databases and their role in shotgun proteomic
	analysis, interpretation of relative peptide quantification data
	in the presence of multiple protein isoforms, the integration of
	proteomic and transcriptional data, and the development of a computational
	infrastructure for the integration of multiple diverse datasets.},

  abstract = {There are a number of leukemogenic protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs)
	associated with leukemic transformation. Although each is linked
	with a specific disease their functional activity poses the question
	whether they have a degree of commonality in their effects upon target
	cells. Exon array analysis of the effects of six leukemogenic PTKs
	(BCR/ABL, TEL/PDGFR, FIP1/PDGFR{alpha}, D816V KIT, NPM/ALK, and FLT3ITD)
	revealed few common effects on the transcriptome. It is apparent,
	however, that proteome changes are not directly governed by transcriptome
	changes. Therefore, we assessed and used a new generation of iTRAQ
	tagging, enabling eight-channel relative quantification discovery
	proteomics, to analyze the effects of these six leukemogenic PTKs.
	Again these were found to have disparate effects on the proteome
	with few common targets. BCR/ABL had the greatest effect on the proteome
	and had more effects in common with FIP1/PDGFR{alpha}. The proteomic
	effects of the four type III receptor kinases were relatively remotely
	related. The only protein commonly affected was eosinophil-associated
	ribonuclease 7. Five of six PTKs affected the motility-related proteins
	CAPG and vimentin, although this did not correspond to changes in
	motility. However, correlation of the proteomics data with that from
	the exon microarray not only showed poor levels of correlation between
	transcript and protein levels but also revealed alternative patterns
	of regulation of the CAPG protein by different oncogenes, illustrating

  abstract = {Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a common complication leading to heightened
	risk of heart failure and death. In the present report, we performed
	proteomic analysis on total cardiac proteins from the OVE26 mouse
	model of type 1 diabetes to identify protein changes that may contribute
	to diabetic cardiomyopathy. This analysis revealed that a surprising
	high proportion (12 of 20) of the altered proteins that could be
	identified by mass spectrometry were of mitochondrial origin. All
	but one of these proteins were upregulated by diabetes. Quantitative
	RT-PCR, performed for two of these proteins, indicated that part
	of the upregulation was attributed to increased messenger RNA levels.
	Morphological study of diabetic hearts showed significantly increased
	mitochondrial area and number as well as focal regions with severe
	damage to mitochondria. Diabetic mitochondria also showed reduced
	respiratory control ratio (9.63 +/- 0.20 vs. 6.13 +/- 0.41, P < 0.0001),
	apparently due to reduced state 3 rate, and diminished GSH level
	(5.5 +/- 0.9 vs. 8.2 +/- 2.5 micromol/mg protein, P < 0.05), indicating
	impaired mitochondrial function and increased oxidative stress. Further
	examination revealed increased mitochondrial DNA (1.03 +/- 0.18 vs.
	0.69 +/- 0.13 relative copy number, P < 0.001) and a tendency to
	higher protein yield in OVE26 cardiac mitochondria, as well as increased
	mRNA level for mitochondrial transcription factor A and two mitochondrial
	encoded proteins. Taken together, these results show that mitochondria
	are a primary target in the diabetic heart, probably due to oxidative
	stress, and that this damage coincides with and may stimulate mitochondrial
	biogenesis.},

  abstract = {The ParagonTM Algorithm, a novel database search engine for the identification
	of peptides from tandem mass spectrometry data, is presented. Sequence
	Temperature Values are computed using a sequence tag algorithm, allowing
	the degree of implication by an MS/MS spectrum of each region of
	a database to be determined on a continuum. Counter to conventional
	approaches, features such as modifications, substitutions, and cleavage
	events are modeled with probabilities rather than by discrete user-controlled
	settings to consider or not consider a feature. The use of feature
	probabilities in conjunction with Sequence Temperature Values allows
	for a very large increase in the effective search space with only
	a very small increase in the actual number of hypotheses that must
	be scored. The algorithm has a new kind of user interface that removes
	the user expertise requirement, presenting control settings in the
	language of the laboratory that are translated to optimal algorithmic
	settings. To validate this new algorithm, a comparison with Mascot
	is presented for a series of analogous searches to explore the relative
	impact of increasing search space probed with Mascot by relaxing
	the tryptic digestion conformance requirements from trypsin to semitrypsin
	to no enzyme and with the Paragon Algorithm using its Rapid mode
	and Thorough mode with and without tryptic specificity. Although
	they performed similarly for small search space, dramatic differences
	were observed in large search space. With the Paragon Algorithm,
	hundreds of biological and artifact modifications, all possible substitutions,
	and all levels of conformance to the expected digestion pattern can
	be searched in a single search step, yet the typical cost in search
	time is only 2-5 times that of conventional small search space. Despite
	this large increase in effective search space, there is no drastic
	loss of discrimination that typically accompanies the exploration
	of large search space.},

	sources of non-genetic variation and correlation. Also detailed is
	a new approach for experimental design that employs partial replication
	in all phases. The motivation for this was the high cost of obtaining
	quality trait data, thus the need to limit the total number of samples
	tested, but still allow use of the mixed model analysis. A simulation
	study is used to show that the combined use of the new designs and
	mixed model analysis has substantial benefits in terms of the genetic
	gain from selection. ???? 2006 Cambridge University Press.},

  abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed
	microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002)
	derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression
	in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical
	parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical
	model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for
	general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments
	and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear
	models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The
	approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color
	microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived
	for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have
	robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete
	data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior
	odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic
	in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place
	of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is
	equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards
	a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the
	number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has
	the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters
	which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the
	non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated
	t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees
	of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate
	tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics.
	The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study.
	Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

	caused by diabetes in heart mitochondria from streptozotocin-treated
	rats. We demonstrated that the expression of proteins from the myocardial
	tricarboxylic acid cycle was not altered in diabetes. However, up-regulation
	of the fatty acid beta-oxidation favored fatty acids over glucose
	as a source of acetyl CoA for the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Protein
	levels for several proteins involved in electron transport were modestly
	decreased. Whether this may depress overall ATP production remains
	to be established, since the protein level of ATP synthase seems
	to be unchanged. Other changes include down-regulation of protein
	levels for creatine kinase, voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC-1),
	HSP60, and Grp75. The mitochondria-associated level of albumin was
	decreased, while the level of catalase was substantially increased.
	All of the changes were evident as early as 1 week after streptozotocin
	administration. Taken together, these data point to a rapid and highly
	coordinated regulation of mitochondrial protein expression that occurs

	their corresponding proteolytic peptides appear as single peaks in

	We observed efficient liberation of reporter ions for singly protonated
	peptides at low-energy collision conditions. In contrast, increased
	collision energies were required to liberate the iTRAQ label from
	lysine side chains of doubly charged peptides and, thus, to observe
	reporter ions suitable for relative quantification of proteins with
	high accuracy. We then developed a quantitative strategy that comprises
	labeling of intact proteins by iTRAQ followed by gel electrophoresis
